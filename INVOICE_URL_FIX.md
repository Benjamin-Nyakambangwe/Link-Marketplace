# üêõ Invoice URL Fix - RESOLVED

## The Problem

When clicking "View & Pay Invoice", you were being sent to:
```
https://api.sandbox.paypal.com/v2/invoicing/invoices/INV2-CQAC-BNED-HVVE-WHHN
```

This is an **API endpoint** (for machines), not a **web page** (for humans)! 

That's why you got the authentication error - your browser was trying to access an API that requires authentication headers.

## The Solution

### ‚úÖ What I Fixed:

1. **Updated Invoice Creation** (`app/api/payments/create-invoice/route.ts`):
   - Now generates the correct **public invoice URL** instead of the API URL
   - Format: `https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/invoice/p/#INVOICE_ID`

2. **Added Backward Compatibility**:
   - **Advertiser Page** (`app/advertiser/orders/[id]/page.tsx`)
   - **Publisher Page** (`app/publisher/orders/[id]/page.tsx`)
   - Automatically converts old API URLs to public URLs for existing invoices

## How to Test

### Option 1: Use Existing Invoice (with auto-fix)
1. **Refresh** your order page
2. Click **"View & Pay Invoice"** again
3. The URL will be **automatically converted** to the correct format
4. You should now see the PayPal invoice page (not the API error)

### Option 2: Create New Invoice (clean start)
1. Create a new order
2. Publisher accepts it
3. New invoice will have the correct URL from the start

## What You'll See Now

‚úÖ **Correct URL Format:**
```
https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/invoice/p/#INV2-CQAC-BNED-HVVE-WHHN
```

This is a **web page** where you can:
- View invoice details
- Log in with PayPal test account
- Pay the invoice

---

## Next Steps

1. **Click "View & Pay Invoice"** - should work now!
2. **Log in** with a PayPal sandbox test account
   - Get credentials from: https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/accounts
3. **Pay the invoice**
4. Order status will update automatically (via webhook)

---

## Future Invoices

All new invoices created from now on will automatically use the correct public URL format. No more authentication errors! üéâ
