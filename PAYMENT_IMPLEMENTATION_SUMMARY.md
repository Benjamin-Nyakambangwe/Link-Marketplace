## 📁 Files Created

### 1. Database Migration
**File:** `lib/supabase/add-payment-system-migration.sql`

**What it creates:**
- `payments` table - Tracks PayPal invoices sent to advertisers
- `payouts` table - Tracks PayPal payouts sent to publishers
- `paypal_email` column in `profiles` table
- `payment_status` and `payout_scheduled_at` columns in `orders` table
- New order statuses: `payment_pending`, `payment_processing`, `paid`
- RLS policies for secure access

**To apply:** Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor

   - Reverts order to "completed"
   - Alerts admin for manual handling

4. `INVOICING.INVOICE.CANCELLED` - When invoice is cancelled

**Security:** Verifies PayPal webhook signatures

### 3. Frontend Updates

#### **`app/publisher/orders/[id]/page.tsx`**

**Changes:**
- Added `payment_status` and `payment` data to interface
- Updated `fetchOrderDetails()` to fetch payment data
- Modified `acceptOrder()` to:
  - Set status to `payment_pending`
  - Call invoice API
  - Show success message
- Added payment protection to `submitWork()` - blocks until payment received
- Added payment status UI cards:
  - ⏳ "Waiting for Payment" when `payment_pending`
  - ✅ "Payment Received" when `in_progress`
  - 💰 "You've Been Paid!" when `paid`

**User Experience:**
1. Publisher accepts → sees "Waiting for Payment" alert
2. Advertiser pays → Publisher sees "Payment Received, start work!"
3. Work completed, advertiser approves → Publisher sees "You've Been Paid!"

3. Pays → Webhook updates order to "in_progress"
4. Work submitted → Reviews and approves

## 🔄 Complete Payment Workflow

### Step-by-Step Flow

```
1. ADVERTISER: Creates order
   Status: pending

2. PUBLISHER: Clicks "Accept Order"
   ├─ Status: payment_pending
   ├─ API: /api/payments/create-invoice
   ├─ PayPal invoice created & sent
   └─ Publisher sees: "⏳ Waiting for Payment"

3. ADVERTISER: Receives email, opens invoice
   ├─ Clicks "View & Pay Invoice"
   ├─ Redirected to PayPal
   └─ Pays invoice

4. PAYPAL: Webhook fires → INVOICING.INVOICE.PAID
   ├─ Status: in_progress
   ├─ Payment status: paid
   └─ Publisher notified: "✅ Payment Received"

5. PUBLISHER: Starts work
   ├─ Creates/publishes content
   ├─ Enters published URL
   ├─ Clicks "Submit Work"
   └─ Status: review

6. ADVERTISER: Reviews published content
   ├─ Clicks "Approve Order"
   ├─ Status: payment_processing
   └─ API: /api/payments/create-payout

7. PAYPAL: Creates payout to publisher
   └─ Sends $127.50 to publisher's PayPal

8. PAYPAL: Webhook fires → PAYMENT.PAYOUTS-ITEM.SUCCEEDED
   ├─ Status: paid
   ├─ Publisher sees: "💰 You've Been Paid!"
   └─ ✅ ORDER COMPLETE!
```

## 💵 Money Flow Example

**Order Total: $150**

```
Advertiser pays: $150.00
  ↓
Your PayPal Business Account
  ↓
  ├─ Platform Fee (15%): $22.50 ← YOU KEEP
  └─ Publisher Payout: $127.50 ← SENT TO PUBLISHER
```

**Commission Calculation:**
```javascript
const platformFeePercentage = 15 / 100 = 0.15
const platformFee = $150 * 0.15 = $22.50
const publisherAmount = $150 - $22.50 = $127.50
```

---

## 🔧 Setup Required

### 1. Run Database Migration
In Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Copy and run: lib/supabase/add-payment-system-migration.sql
```

### 2. Add Environment Variables
Create `.env.local` with:

```bash
# PayPal Sandbox (for testing)
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_sandbox_client_id
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_sandbox_secret
PAYPAL_API_URL=https://api-m.sandbox.paypal.com
PAYPAL_BUSINESS_NAME="Your Marketplace"
PAYPAL_BUSINESS_EMAIL=billing@yourmarketplace.com
PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID=your_webhook_id
PLATFORM_FEE_PERCENTAGE=15

# Production (when ready)
# PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_live_client_id
# PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_live_secret
# PAYPAL_API_URL=https://api-m.paypal.com
```

### 3. Set Up PayPal Webhooks
1. Go to https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/webhooks
2. Click "Create Webhook"
3. **Webhook URL:** `https://yourdomain.com/api/payments/webhooks/paypal`
4. **Select Events:**
   - `INVOICING.INVOICE.PAID`
   - `PAYMENT.PAYOUTS-ITEM.SUCCEEDED`
   - `PAYMENT.PAYOUTS-ITEM.FAILED`
   - `INVOICING.INVOICE.CANCELLED`
5. Copy Webhook ID to `.env.local`

### 4. Publisher Setup
Publishers need to add their PayPal email to their profile:
- Go to Settings/Profile
- Add PayPal Email (field was added to `profiles` table)
- This is where they'll receive payouts

---

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Using PayPal Sandbox

1. **Create Test Accounts**
   - Go to https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/accounts
   - Create test Personal account (for advertiser)
   - Your Business account receives platform payments

2. **Test the Flow:**
   ```
   1. Create order as advertiser
   2. Accept as publisher
   3. Check advertiser email for invoice
   4. Login to sandbox.paypal.com with test account
   5. Pay the invoice
   6. Watch webhook fire → order becomes "in_progress"
   7. Submit work as publisher
   8. Approve as advertiser
   9. Watch payout webhook → publisher gets paid
   ```

3. **Check Webhook Logs:**
   - PayPal Dashboard > Webhooks > Your Webhook > Recent Deliveries
   - See all events and responses

## 🛡️ Security Features

✅ **Authentication:** All API endpoints verify user auth  
✅ **Authorization:** Only order participants can take actions  
✅ **Webhook Verification:** PayPal signatures validated  
✅ **RLS Policies:** Database enforces access control  
✅ **Payment Validation:** Checks status before allowing actions  

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Payment Protection
- Publishers **cannot start work** until payment is confirmed
- Check in `submitWork()` blocks submission if not paid
- UI clearly shows "Waiting for Payment" status

### Error Handling
- **Invoice fails:** Error shown to publisher, order stays pending
- **Payout fails:** Order reverts to completed, admin alerted
- **Webhook fails:** Automatic retries by PayPal

### Hold Period (Optional)
Currently disabled, but you can add a 7-day hold:
```javascript
// In approveOrder, instead of immediate payout:
payout_scheduled_at: 7 days from now
// Then cron job sends payout after 7 days
```

### Commission Rate
Set in `.env.local`:
```bash
PLATFORM_FEE_PERCENTAGE=15  # Change to your desired percentage
```
